## Curiosity might have killed the cat, but it might as well save us

As I mentioned before in the [About Me](https://www.forquosh.dev/posts/aboutme) post, I have always been in search of answers to my questions. The things that sparked my curiosity (and sometimes even kept me up at night) were received with total disinterest by most people I knew. Now I understand why: _it's not pleasant_.

**Yet it might be the most rewarding thing I have done in my life, for it grounded me in myself, opening my eyes to the whole world and the mystery of it.**

My journey in philosophy and religion (even psychology, of late) started not so much from the questions I had, but from the unbearably true and harsh statements philosophers, some more renowned than others, made. Coming up are a few quotes I wrote in my journal a few years ago that still come up in my mind once in a while:

- <div>
    <p>_The awful thing is that beauty is mysterious as well as terrible. God and the devil are fighting there, and the battlefield is the heart of man._</p>
    <p align="right">- Fyodor Dostoevsky</p>
  </div>

- <div>
    <p>_People are strange: They are constantly angered by trivial things, but on a major matter like totally wasting their lives, they hardly seem to notice._</p>
    <p>_We're all going to die, what a circus! that alone should make us love each other, yet it doesn't. We are terrorised and flattened by trivialities, we are eaten up by nothing._</p>
    <p align="right">- Charles Bukowski</p>
  </div>

- <div>
    <p>_A man can do what he wills, but cannot will what he wills._</p>
    <p align="right">- Arthur Schopenhauer</p>
  </div>

- <div>
    <p>_Most people are other people. Their thoughts are someone else's opinions, their lives a mimicry, their passions a quotation._</p>
    <p align="right">- Oscar Wilde</p>
  </div>

- <div>
    <p>_The search for reality is the most dangerous of all undertakings, for it destroys the world in which you live._</p>
    <p align="right">- Nisargadatta Maharaj</p>
  </div>

These quotes, as well as many others, having laid out the foundation of my becoming, were now up to question. I needed to make sure they were the 'real deal', so to speak. I couldn't accept anyone making this kind of statements and then doing a mic drop, never coming up with a solution. 'Haunting' poorly describes this situation.

_Much reading and thought later, I realised..._

...they **tried**. They all tried to make sense out of it, just as I did and still do. I listened and did my best to reconcile what they thought, lived and wrote about with my life and my experience. Yet some of my questions never went away, just multiplied like rabbits! Seems a pretty unsuccessful endeavor.

Well, _not really_. The questions may have abounded, but they were deeper, more well-put, regarding greater and greater matters. I soon realised I had made peace with the thoughts that invaded my mind years ago, months ago, even weeks ago. I became more and more confident, understanding, loving; capable of listening, feeling and reasoning. My ability to articulate thoughts and ideas increased tremendously, as well as my capability to help others by entertaining more and more serious discussions about any subject it came to (maybe except mass-media, gossip and present-time politics :) )

In the ending, I propose a final quote, one that stands at the pinnacle of my principles:

<div>
    <p>_**The cleverest of all, in my opinion, is the man who calls himself a fool at least once a month.**_</p>
    <p align="right">- Fyodor Dostoevsky</p>
</div>

_Be the fool. Be willing to bravely and carelessly pursue anything you set your mind to. This pursuit is your reward, and there is none greater._

### _Thanks for reading! Cheers! :D_
