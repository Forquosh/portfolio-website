## _Let Me Introduce Myself_

Hi there! My name is **Mihai-Cristian Farcaș**, I am currently 20 years old and
studying Computer Science at the Faculty of Mathematics and Computer Science,
Babeș-Bolyai University, Cluj-Napoca. I enjoy learning and applying what I learn
in day-to-day life. Some of my greatest passions are programming, psychology,
philosophy, religion, literature, music and art.

When I finally free myself from the books' grasp, I enjoy working out, swimming
and taking walks in the park where dogs play and people take life
slowly.

## _Always Asking 'Why?'_

Ever since early childhood I have been asking myself and the people I knew the toughest questions, expecting nothing less than the toughest answers. Growing up I realised no answers were definitive, no real destination to reach. Just a journey to be created and experienced, through love and conscious effort.

I know I'm still only taking my first steps through life, but I've been obsessed with doing things right for me and my loved ones. So far, so good :).

## _A Carreer Of Creation_

Programming gives me infinite possibilities of creation. Even though I chose to pursue this field for the obvious benefits of money, freedom and leverage, the creative part is what really grabbed me and keeps me going further than I previously imagined I would. This website is the very beginning of so many great things I wish to build throughout my carreer.

Where science and art meet, divinity dwells. Just like the works of all greatest human beings.
