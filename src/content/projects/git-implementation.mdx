## _My Git Implementation in Python_

This project is a simple Git implementation in Python, built from scratch, to demonstrate core functionalities of Git, including **cloning a repository, writing objects, creating commits, and more**. It was written and tested throughout the **"Build your own git" challenge on Codecrafters**. The code supports several key Git commands and can be expanded upon for learning purposes.

## _Features_

- **Initialize a Git Repository**: Manually create the `.git` folder and initialize the necessary directory structure.
- **Create Objects**: Store blobs, commits, and trees in a way that mirrors how Git stores data.
- **Commit Trees**: Simulate the creation of commit objects linked to tree objects.
- **Clone Repositories**: Clone repositories by fetching data from remote servers.
- **Read and Decompress Git Objects**: View the contents of Git objects stored in the `.git` folder.

## _Supported Git Commands_

The project supports the following commands (executed through the Python script):

1. **`init`**: Initialize a new Git repository.

```bash
./your_program.sh init
```

2. **`hash-object -w <file>`**: Write the contents of a file into the .git/objects folder as a blob.

```bash
./your_program.sh hash-object -w <file>
```

3. **`write-tree`**: Write a tree object representing the current directory structure.

```bash
./your_program.sh write-tree
```

4. **`commit-tree <tree_sha> -p <commit_sha> -m <message>`**: Create a commit object from a tree object, linking it to a parent commit and adding a message.

```bash
./your_program.sh commit-tree <tree_sha> -p <commit_sha> -m <message>
```

5. **`clone <repo_url> <directory>`**: Clone a remote Git repository into a specified directory.

```bash
./your_program.sh clone <repo_url> <directory>
```

## _How the Code Works_

### Cloning a Repository

The clone command initiates by creating a .git folder and fetching refs from the remote repository. After retrieving the pack file, the script processes the objects, decompressing and creating them within the cloned directory.

### The steps include

- Fetching refs from the remote URL.
- Fetching the pack file containing repository objects.
- Decompressing objects and creating corresponding tree, blob, and commit files.
- Rendering the directory structure based on the tree object.
- Creating and Storing Objects
- When files are committed, they are stored as objects in the .git/objects folder using SHA-1 hashes. The create_object function handles creating these objects by compressing and writing data to the object store.
